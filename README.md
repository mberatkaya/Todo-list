This project is a To-Do List application developed using the Go programming language, the Fiber web framework, and the MongoDB NoSQL database. The application follows RESTful API principles and provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

Additionally, the project includes features such as password hashing and test writing, ensuring enhanced security and quality assurance.

Features
Create, delete, update, and mark tasks as complete.
Password hashing for user authentication (using bcrypt).
RESTful API endpoints for seamless integration.
Unit and integration tests to verify application functionality.
High-performance HTTP request handling with the Fiber framework.

Technologies Used
Go (Golang): A programming language known for its performance and simplicity.
Fiber (v2): A fast and flexible web framework for handling HTTP requests.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing task data.
bcrypt: A library for securely hashing user passwords.
Testing Framework: (e.g., Goâ€™s testing package or other preferred tools) used to verify API and business logic.
